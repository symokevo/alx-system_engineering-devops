# Web stack debugging #0

This was the first in a series of initiatives aimed at troubleshooting the web stack. In these project, I was handed broken/bugged webstacks in isolated containers and entrusted with bringing the web stack back up to speed.

I created a script that automates the actions required to repair the web stack
## Task :page_with_curl:

* **0. Give me a page!**
  * [0-give_me_a_page](./0-give_me_a_page): Bash script that runs Apache on a
  web server and gets it to respond to queries to the root.

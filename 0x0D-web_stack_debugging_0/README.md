Introduction
Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to easily build, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that contain all the necessary dependencies, libraries, and configurations to run an application.

Docker is widely used in the software development industry because it provides a consistent, portable, and scalable way to manage applications and their dependencies.

Key Concepts
Images
An image is a read-only template that contains all the instructions necessary to create a container. Images are built from a Dockerfile, which is a text file that contains all the necessary instructions to create an image.

Containers
A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that contains all the necessary dependencies, libraries, and configurations to run an application. Containers are created from images, and multiple containers can be created from the same image.

Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains all the necessary instructions to build an image. It specifies the base image, the dependencies, and the commands needed to create the image.

Registry
A Docker registry is a central location where Docker images are stored and distributed. Docker Hub is the most popular registry for Docker images, but there are many other public and private registries available.

Installation
To use Docker, you first need to install it on your system. Docker provides installation instructions for different platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Basic Usage
Once you have installed Docker, you can use the command-line interface to perform various operations, including building images, creating containers, and managing Docker resources.
